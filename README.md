<h1>Java Hibernate App</h1>
This is a Java Hibernate application connected with Gui form. 
This is an example of a company application that enters worker data, update, deletes, shows all workers, and filter based on age.

This is my first project. Through it, I learned how and where to use annotations and how to connect the application with MySQL database,
how to setup hibernate.cfg.xml file. 
Hibernateutil class served me as a helper class. It contains all the logic, configuration and methods for SesionFactory.

The most difficult and at the same time the most interesting part was organizing the Gui form and connect all buttons in the Main class.
